\title{ocv_text text detection in images using EAST}
\usage{
ocv_text(
  image,
  thrs = 0.5,
  nms = 20,
  width = 320,
  height = 320,
  model,

}
\arguments{
\item{image}{opencv image to be processed.}

\item{thrs}{Confidence threshold between 0 and 1.}

\item{nms}{Non-maximum suppression threshold.}

\item{width}{Preprocess input image by resizing to a specific width. It
should be multiple by 32.}

\item{height}{Preprocess input image by resizing to a specific height. It
should be multiple by 32.}

\item{model}{Path to a binary .pb file contains trained network.}

\item{draw}{Draws visual output to the image.}
}
\description{
OpenCV sample using EAST (Efficient and Accurate Scene Text
Detector) to detect text in images. Requires the EAST pb-model not included
in the package.
