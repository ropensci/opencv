Description: Experimenting with computer vision and machine learning in R. This 
    package exposes some of the available 'OpenCV' <https://opencv.org/> algorithms,
    such as edge, body or face detection. These can either be applied to analyze 
    static images, or to filter live video footage from a camera device.
